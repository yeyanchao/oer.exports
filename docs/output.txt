The output is designed to be automatically parsed.
Ideally, the id of the original element will be passed through all stages of generation
so the error can be given back to the author, but for now, an XPath to the offending element is given.


The conversion and cleanup passes output useful information.
Any elements that have not been converted output a "BUG:"
Any elements that are cleaned up output a "WARNING:"
Any elements that are invalid XML (usually math) output a "ERROR:"

The MathML to SVG conversion uses XSLT2. If there is a problem with the MathML a stack trace is printed with the cause of the problem.
